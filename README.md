# CPSC222-MonkeyType-Data-Project
Code for my Data Science project for mining my typing data from the website MonkeyType. 

If you are interested in improving your typing speeds, this is a very minimalistic typing test website that you should definitely check out!

## Running the Project

Make sure that all json files, csv files, and `utils.py` are all in the same directory as`Monkey_Type_Report.ipynb`. Downloading the zip file from GitHub and/or cloning/forking the repo should keep this in check. Also make sure that the code cells are indeed run from top to bottom because the code works best when it is run from top to bottom.
